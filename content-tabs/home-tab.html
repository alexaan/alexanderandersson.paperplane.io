			Thank you for visiting my personal website. I am Alexander Andersson, currently an applicant for programming jobs in Norway.
			I received an <strong>MSc in Computer Science</strong>, with study specialisation 'software', from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) earlier in 2015. I graduated from Ã…lesund University College (HIALS) in 2012, where I finished my <strong>Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science</strong>.
		</p>  
		<p>
			I created this site after having finished my Master's, both to get a personal introduction to development with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, and to create a showcase for some of my completed projects. More projects and other content will be added at a later date.

			Full source code for this site can be found on <a href="https://github.com/alexaan/alexanderandersson.paperplane.io">GitHub</a>. Please keep in mind that the <strong>site is still in development</strong>. Some issuses that are currently being worked on:
		</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The image gallery in the 'Projects' tab</strong> may not work correctly in every browser and on every device.</li>
			<li>This site does currently not work as intended in browsers that don't <strong>support HTML5.</strong></li>
		</ul>
