				Welcome, and thank you for visiting my personal website! I am Alexander Andersson, currently a job applicant for programming positions in Norway.
				I received a MSc in Computer Science, with study specialisation 'software', from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) earlier in 2015. I graduated from Ã…lesund University College in 2012, where I finished my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.

				I created this site after having finished my Master's, both to get a personal introduction to development with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, and to create a showcase for some of my projects. Please keep in mind that the <strong>site is still in development</strong>, with particular focus on styling for smaller screens and various code optimisation. More content may be added at a later date.
