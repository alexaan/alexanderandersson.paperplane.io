			<p>
				Thank you for visiting my personal website. I am Alexander Andersson, currently a job applicant for programming positions in Norway.
				I received an <strong>MSc in Computer Science</strong>, with study specialisation 'software', from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) earlier in 2015. I graduated from Ã…lesund University College in 2012, where I finished my <strong>Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science</strong>.

				I created this site after having finished my Master's, both to get a personal introduction to development with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, and to create a showcase for some of my completed projects. More projects and other content will be added at a later date.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please keep in mind that the <strong>site is still in development</strong>, with particular focus on styling for smaller screens and various code optimisation. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;" >Image galleries are currently not working well on smaller screens (mobile).</span>
